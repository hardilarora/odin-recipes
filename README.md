# odin-recipes
This project requires building a basic recipe website.
It will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
Completion of this project will show basic understanding of html including:
    working with text;
    lists;
    links and images.

The project has been completed. I will return to it in the future to improve the design with CSS.
