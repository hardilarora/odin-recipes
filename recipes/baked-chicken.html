    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Perfectly tender and juicy chicken cutlets are topped with mild or hot giardiniera (your choice!) and provolone cheese. Play around with different crouton flavors for variety.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (4 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups butter and garlic croutons</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>½ cup giardiniera</li>
        <li>4 slices provolone cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Pound chicken breasts with a meat mallet to an even 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch thickness. Season with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li>Pulse croutons in a small food processor until they have a fine consistency. Put flour, eggs, and crouton crumbs into 3 separate shallow dishes.</li>
        <li>Dip each breast first into flour, shaking off the excess. Next, dip into egg mixture, letting any excess drip off. Coat chicken in crouton crumbs and set on a plate.</li>
        <li>Heat oil over medium heat in a large oven-proof skillet until hot. Fry chicken for 2 minutes, flip, and fry an additional 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons giardiniera and 1 slice of cheese.</li>
        <li>Cook in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Top with parsley before serving.</li>
    </ol>
